1. Goal of the Game
===================
Kill anything that moves. Kill multiple enemies in a row for a special bonus ;).

2. Controls
===========
Arrow Keys - Move your character
Left Ctrl - Attack
Esc - Quit
Enter - Advance to the next level

3. Building
===========

Use the provided Makefiles with a DMDFE 2.059 D compiler. On 32 bit linux dmd works best, on 64 bit linux LDC2 works best. On Windows dmd works best. You'll also need DAllegro and TangoD2. I suggest you use the binaries I provide.

4. TINS Rules
=============

1. Genre requirement: creative anachronism: combine two elements that are obviously from different time area's

Justification:
Your character wields a sword and can turn into a dragon while fighting modern soldiers with plasma weaponry.

2. Artistic requirement: Here be dragons

Justification:
Your character can turn into a dragon.

3. Technical requirement #1: Must have way to record progress / save games

Justification:
Upon completion of a level you are given a password that you can enter in the main menu to continue from that point

4. Technical requirement #2: multilayer scrolling (=parallax scrolling)

Justification:
Clouds in the background use parallax scrolling

5. Techincal requirement #3: prominent use of prime numbers

Justification:
Prime number combos yield bonuses. Primes are also used as passwords.

6. Bonus rule: Act of Guttenberg - swap a rule for a rule of an earlier competition, if you re-use code from an entry from that competition (not your own).  You can apply this rule several times if you re-use code from several entries.

Justification:
Not invoked.

5. Source code reuse
====================

The bulk of the engine was created before the competition, and was posted in the allegro.cc thread created for this purpose: http://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/610656
The paralax code was taken from my SantaHack 2011 entry, Cortex Terror.
